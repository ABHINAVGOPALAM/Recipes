    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups grated carrots</li>
        <li>4 cups grated carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust according to taste)      </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)   </li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped nuts (cashews, almonds, pistachios)        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder        </li>
        <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)        </li>
        <li>Raisins for garnish (optional)        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai on medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of ghee to it.</li>
        <li>Once the ghee has melted, add the grated carrots to the pan. Stir well to coat the carrots with ghee.</li>
        <li>Cook the carrots on medium heat for about 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will help release the moisture from the carrots</li>
        <li>Add the milk to the pan and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and let the carrots simmer in the milk. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking</li>
        <li>Allow the carrots to cook in the milk until most of the liquid has evaporated. This will take approximately 30-40 minutes. Keep stirring occasionally to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a separate pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of ghee. Add the chopped nuts and sauté until they turn golden brown. Keep them aside.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid has reduced and the carrots are cooked, add sugar to the pan. Mix well until the sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking the mixture on low heat until the halwa thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan. This will take another 15-20 minutes. Keep stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Add the cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using). Mix well to combine the flavors.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the sautéed nuts to the halwa and mix them in. Reserve a few nuts for garnish, if desired.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and let the halwa cool down slightly before serving. You can serve it warm or chilled, garnished with raisins and extra nuts.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade carrot halwa!</li>
    </ol>

        <strong>Note:</strong>The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the carrots and the desired consistency of the halwa. Adjust the sugar quantity according to your taste preference.
